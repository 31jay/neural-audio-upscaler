## How It Works üîç

The Neural Audio Upscaler leverages deep learning algorithms to analyze and enhance audio quality. Here‚Äôs a brief overview of the underlying technology:

### Deep Learning Models

We utilize advanced neural networks that have been trained on a vast dataset of audio files. These models learn to identify and enhance audio features that contribute to sound quality.

### Signal Processing Techniques

The application employs various signal processing techniques, including:

- **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**: Used to analyze the frequency components of the audio signal.
- **Wavelet Transform**: Helps in decomposing the audio signal for better feature extraction.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Optimize the upscaling process based on learned patterns.

### GUI Components

The graphical interface is designed for ease of use, featuring intuitive buttons and sliders that allow users to control the upscaling process without technical knowledge.
